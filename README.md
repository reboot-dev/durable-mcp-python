# Reboot *Durable* MCP

A framework for building _durable_ MCP servers.

* Takes advantage of the protocols ability to resume after
  disconnection, e.g., due to the server getting rebooted.

* Any existing requests will be retried safely using Reboot workflows.

* Using Reboot you can run multiple replicas of your server, and
  session messages will always be routed to the same replica.

### Requirements
- macOS or Linux
- Python >= 3.12.11
- Docker

### Install

We recommend using `uv`, as it will manage the version of Python for
you. For example, to start a new project in the directory `foo`:

```console
uv init --python 3.12.11 .
uv add durable-mcp
```

Activate the `venv`:

```console
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure you have Docker running:

```console
docker ps
```

### Building an MCP server

Instead of using `FastMCP` from the MCP SDK, you use
`DurableMCP`. Here is a simple server to get you started:

```python
import asyncio
from reboot.aio.applications import Application
from reboot.mcp.server import DurableContext, DurableMCP
from reboot.std.collections.v1.sorted_map import SortedMap

# `DurableMCP` server which will handle HTTP requests at path "/mcp".
mcp = DurableMCP(path="/mcp")


@mcp.tool()
async def add(a: int, b: int, context: DurableContext) -> int:
    """Add two numbers and also store result in `SortedMap`."""
    result = a + b
    await SortedMap.ref("adds").Insert(
        context,
        entries={f"{a} + {b}": f"{result}".encode()},
    )
    return result


async def main():
    # Reboot application that runs everything necessary for `DurableMCP`.
    await mcp.application().run()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can run the server via:

```console
rbt dev run --python --application=path/to/main.py --working-directory=. --no-generate-watch
```

While developing you can tell `rbt` to restart your server when you
modify files by adding one or more `--watch=path/to/**/*.py` to the
above command line.

We recommend you move all of your command line args to a `.rbtrc`:

```bash
# This file will aggregate all of the command line args
# into a single command line that will be run when you
# use `rbt`.
#
# For example, to add args for running `rbt dev run`
# you can add lines that start with `dev run`. You can add
# one or more args to each line.
dev run --no-generate-watch
dev run --python --application=path/to/your/main.py
dev run --watch=path/to/**/*.py --watch=different/path/to/**/*.py
```

Then you can just run:

```console
rbt dev run
```

### Testing your MCP server

You can use the [MCP
Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/tools/inspector) to
test out the server, or create a simple client.

```python
import asyncio
from reboot.mcp.client import connect, reconnect

URL = "http://localhost:9991"


async def main():
    # `connect()` is a helper that creates a streamable HTTP client
    # and session using the MCP SDK. You can also write a client the
    # direclty uses the MCP SDK you prefer!
    async with connect(URL + "/mcp") as (
        session, session_id, protocol_version
    ):
        print(await session.list_tools())
        print(await session.call_tool("add", arguments={"a": 5, "b": 3}))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Performing a side-effect "at least once"

Within your tools (and eventually within your prompts and resources
too), you can try and perform a side-effect that it is safe to try one
or more times until success using `at_least_once`. Usually what makes
it safe to perform one or more times is that you can somehow do it
_idempotently_, e.g., passing an idempotency key as part of an API
call. Use `at_least_once` for this, for example:

```python
from reboot.aio.workflows import at_least_once
from reboot.mcp.server import DurableContext, DurableMCP


# `DurableMCP` server which will handle HTTP requests at path "/mcp".
mcp = DurableMCP(path="/mcp")


@mcp.tool()
async def add(a: int, b: int, context: DurableContext) -> int:

    async def do_side_effect_idempotently() -> int:
        """
        Pretend that we are doing a side-effect that we can try
        more than once because we can do it idempotently, hence using
        `at_least_once`.
        """
        return a + b

    result = await at_least_once(
        "Do side-effect _idempotently_",
        context,
        do_side_effect_idempotently,
        type=int,
    )

    # ...
```

### Performing a side-effect "at most once"

Within your tools (and eventually within your prompts and resources
too), you can try and perform a side-effect that can _only_ be tried
once using `at_most_once`. If you can attempt to perform the
side-effect more than once always prefer `at_least_once`. Here's an
example of `at_most_once`:

```python
from reboot.aio.workflows import at_least_once
from reboot.mcp.server import DurableContext, DurableMCP


# `DurableMCP` server which will handle HTTP requests at path "/mcp".
mcp = DurableMCP(path="/mcp")


@mcp.tool()
async def add(a: int, b: int, context: DurableContext) -> int:

    async def do_side_effect() -> int:
        """
        Pretend that we are doing a side-effect that we can only
        try to do once because it is not able to be performed
        idempotently, hence using `at_most_once`.
        """
        return a + b

    # NOTE: if we reboot, e.g., due to a hardware failure, within
    # `do_side_effect()` then `at_most_once` will forever raise with
    # `AtMostOnceFailedBeforeCompleting` and you will need to handle
    # appropriately.
    result = await at_most_once(
        "Do side-effect",
        context,
        do_side_effect,
        type=int,
    )

    # ...
```

### Debugging

Start by enabling debug logging:

```python
mcp = DurableMCP(path="/mcp", log_level="DEBUG")
```

Then consider wrapping your tool/prompt/etc functions in a
`try`/`except` because the MCP SDK will "swallow" errors and all that
the client gets back is just that the request failed.
